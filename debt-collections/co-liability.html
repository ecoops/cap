	    <p>[In some cases when you have a debt you have not paid, we can legally ask someone who owes you money or holds money for you to send us that money. This is often your employer or a financial institution, but can also include a spouse, business partner, director, individual, corporation, or another government department.]</p>
	    	     <details><summary>If you transfer property to a related person or corporation (non-arm's-length transfers)</summary>
	    <p>If you have a debt with the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>, then transfer property to an individual or corporation that is <a title="Non-arm's length" class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#inline_content_modal3">non-arm's length</a>, there could be consequences.</p>
<p>If the property was transferred for <strong>less than</strong> <a title="fair market value" class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#inline_content_modal2">fair market value</a>, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> can issue an assessment against the recipient of the property. The amount of the assessment will be for the <strong>difference </strong>between the fair market value<strong> </strong>of the property and what the recipient paid for it. The assessment will only include debt that was incurred up to, and including, the date of the transfer.</p>

	    <p>If you receive an <abbr title="requirement to pay">RTP</abbr> from the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>, you are legally obligated to comply with it. If you fail to comply, you will become liable for the amount you did not pay, and the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will take legal action to collect that amount from you.</p>
<p>As a recipient of an <abbr title="requirement to pay">RTP</abbr>, you become liable if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>do not pay the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> when you owe money to a taxpayer</li>
<li>continue to pay the taxpayer amounts you are legally required to pay to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr></li>
<li>pay someone else on behalf of the taxpayer, such as a relative or another creditor, instead of the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr></li>
<li>loan or advance money to the taxpayer within 90 days, as specified in the terms of the <abbr title="requirement to pay">RTP</abbr></li>

<details><summary>If you do not obtain a clearance certificate</summary>
<p>As the legal representative of an estate, business or property, you must apply for a clearance certificate before you distribute any assets, unless you are a trustee in bankruptcy. </p>
<p>The clearance certificate is proof that the taxpayer or registrant has paid all outstanding amounts owed to the CRA, or that the CRA has accepted security for the payment.</p>
<p>If you do not obtain a certificate, you can be held liable and subject to a third party assessment.</p>
<p>When a receiver is selling secured property to pay a security interest, they do not need a clearance certificate because the taxpayer does not own the property.

	    <details><summary>If your business fails to remit required payroll or GST/HST amounts</summary>
<p>[If you have not remitted your payroll or GST/HST amounts the CRA may collect from the creditors of the business or, if it’s a corporation, the directors of the corporation.]</p>
<p><strong>Collecting amounts from directors of corporations</strong></p>
<p>[CRA can issue a <strong>directors’ liability assessment</strong> against the corporation’s directors at the time when the corporation failed to deduct, withhold, or pay trust amounts. This assessment makes the directors personally liable, together with the corporation, to pay part or all of the corporation’s trust debt. It allows the CRA to take legal action against the directors to collect the debt as it would from the corporation. The liability includes penalties and interest associated with these trust amounts.]</p>
<p><strong>Collecting amounts from creditors of businesses</strong></p>
<p>[The CRA has the authority to collect amounts considered held “in trust” by your business. These amounts include payroll deductions and GST/HST collected. This claim letter gives the CRA priority over other creditors collecting amounts owed to them. If you have a deemed trust debt owing to the CRA, the amount of the debt becomes secured to the CRA over all your assets, regardless of any security interest you may have given to other creditors. The CRA also has priority over the proceeds of the sale of any of your assets.</p>
<p>The CRA does not have to register deemed trust debts in a public registry, such as a personal property security registry or a land titles office registry.</p>
<p>The CRA may issue a <strong>deemed trust claim letter</strong> to a creditor because of the CRA's priority over the proceeds of a sale. This could occur, for example, if you sold a business asset and used the proceeds of the sale to pay a debt to a creditor, instead of paying your deemed trust debt to the CRA.</p>
<p>The CRA cannot declare a GST/HST deemed trust claim against a secured creditor who received proceeds from the sale of a taxpayer’s assets if the taxpayer has filed an insolvency event, unless the CRA established their security interest before/upon the filing.   </p>
<p>Deemed trust priority can be a complicated issue. You may wish to seek legal or professional advice.]</p>
