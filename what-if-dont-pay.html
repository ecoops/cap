<h2 id="actions">Legal actions we may take to collect your debt</h2>   
	    <p>If you do not call us or make a payment arrangement, we may take legal action to collect certain balances you owe. </p>
<p>If you owe an individual tax or benefit debt, we will make several attempts to <a href="#notify">notify you verbally and in writing</a> before we begin collections actions.</p>
	    
	<h3 id="corporate-actions">Corporate debts and COVID-19 business subsidy debts</h3>
	    
<p>For <strong>corporations</strong>, the notice of assessment or reassessment is considered the written legal warning for goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) and payroll deduction amounts owing. Once a verbal legal warning is attempted, the CRA can proceed with collections action, including <a href="setoffs">issuing set-offs</a>. The CRA can continue to collect amounts assessed on these accounts even if you filed an objection or an appeal to the Tax Court. </p>
	    <p>If you are a <strong>large corporation</strong>, as defined in the Income Tax Act, and have filed an objection or an appeal, the CRA can start collecting 50% of your assessed income tax owing right away.</p>
	    <p>For all businesses, if we determine there is a risk of not collecting all or part of your assessed corporate income tax or COVID-19 business subsidy overpayment debt while you are under collection restrictions, we can apply to the Federal Court or the superior court of a province for a <strong>jeopardy order</strong>. This allows the CRA to secure any assets that you own and to take immediate action to collect the debt. [What is the right order to disclose this information in?]</p>

	    <p><mark>How can we best organize this section so it answers the question "what are all the things the CRA can do to collect my debt?"</mark></p>

<h3>Garnishing wages or other income</h3>
	    <p>[plain text explaining what this means. How is it different than third-party assessments? Can these be merged?]</p>

	    <p>In some cases, the CRA can legally ask a third party to pay your CRA debt. A third party is often your employer or a financial institution, but can also include a spouse, business partner, director, an individual or a corporation that owes you money or holds money for you. These legal requests are sent to third parties from the CRA [by mail?] as a requirement to pay (RTP) or demand on third party (DTP).</p>
<p>The amount requested is typically set at 30% of your take home pay and 100% of funds held in your financial institution. The CRA will apply these funds to your debt.</p>

	    <h3>Asset liens and seizures</h3>
	    <p>[plain text explaining what this means.]</p>
	    <p>The CRA can get a provincial judgement or a certificate from the Federal Court confirming the amount you owe. This will make your debt a matter of public record and allow the CRA to place a lien on or seize your assets. The CRA will usually send you a letter to advise you that if you do not resolve your account, we may take further legal action to pay the debt.</p>
