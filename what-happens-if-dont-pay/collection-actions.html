<h2 id="arrangement">When we start collections actions</h2>

<p>If you have a debt you cannot pay on time, the first thing to do is try to <a href="payment-arrangements.html">make an arrangement to pay your debt in smaller payments over time</a>.
<p>If you have a debt and have not contacted us to make arrangements to pay it, or if you do not make your scheduled payments, we may begin legal collections actions. Normally, we make several attempts to <a href="how-contact.html">notify you verbally and in writing</a> before we begin legal collections actions.</p>

	    
	    <details>
	<summary>Corporate debts and COVID-19 business subsidy debts</summary>
	    
<p id="corporate-actions">For <strong>corporations</strong>, the notice of assessment or reassessment is considered the written legal warning for goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) and payroll deduction amounts owing. Once a verbal legal warning is attempted, the CRA can proceed with collections actions. The CRA can continue to collect amounts assessed on corporate accounts even if you filed an objection or an appeal to the Tax Court. </p>
	    <p>If you are a <strong>large corporation</strong>, as defined in the Income Tax Act, and have filed an objection or an appeal, the CRA can start collecting 50% of your assessed income tax owing right away.</p>
	    <p>For <strong>corporate tax, GST/HST remittance, payroll, and COVID-19 business subsidy debts</strong>, <a href="setoffs">set-offs</a> can be issued as soon as a notice of determination/assessment has been sent.</p>
		    <p>If we determine there is a risk of not collecting all or part of your assessed corporate income tax or COVID-19 business subsidy overpayment debt while you are under collection restrictions, we can apply to the Federal Court or the superior court of a province for a <strong>jeopardy order</strong>. This allows the CRA to secure any assets that you own and to take immediate action to collect the debt.</p>
</details>


	    
<h2 id="garnish">Garnishing your income and accounts, and requesting amounts from third parties</h2>

	    <p>In some cases when you have a debt you have not paid, we can legally ask someone who owes you money or holds money for you to send us that money. This is often your employer or a financial institution, but can also include a spouse, business partner, director, individual, corporation, or another government department. </p>
		    
		   
			    <p>These legal requests are sent from the CRA [by mail?] as a</p>
			 <ul>	    
		    <li>Requirement to Pay (RTP)</li>
		    <li>Demand on Third Party (DTP)</li>
		    <li>Enhanced Requirement to Pay (ERTP) for payroll deductions and GST/HST debts</li>
		    
		    </ul>
		   <p>[If we send someone else a letter related to a debt you owe, you will receive a copy.]</p>
<p>The amount we request is normally 30% of your take home pay and 100% of the funds held in your financial institution. The CRA will apply these funds to your debt.</p>
